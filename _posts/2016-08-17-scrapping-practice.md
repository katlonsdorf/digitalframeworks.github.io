## Average price (and size) of a studio apartment in the nation's capital

In the past few months, I've spent a lot of time on Craigslist's D.C. housing page.  I searched for a summer sublet during third quarter finals prior to moving here in June (that was a nightmare).  And then almost immediately after setting up shop in a shared sublet that is more expensive than my brand new Chicago studio, I hit the web once again, this time in search of fall housing.

I had no idea Washington, D.C. was such an expensive place to live.

I moved to Chicago after a decade of living in Los Angeles, so high rent prices aren't anything new to me.  But in my sun-soaked, west coast bubble, I guess I never realized that D.C. had become such a hot spot.  Manhattan?  Sure.  San Francisco? Yep.  But D.C.?  Word never got to L.A. that America's other favorite two-letter city had gotten so popular.

Craigslist is by no means the only (or most reliable) source for housing options, but it is a good way to gauge the rental market in real-time.  I went through the past week of postings--specifically looking at studio apartments in the immediate D.C. area--and found out, basically, that it might be quite a while until I can afford my own place again.  

Not great news for a 29-year-old.

The average size of a studio posted in the past week for this city is about 485 square feet.  The average price is $1,993. If you use the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/figure-out-how-much-rent-you-can-afford-with-the-40x-ru-1725085955">40x rule </a>, you'd need to make $79,720 a year to healthily afford that rent.

I'm sure I'll be making that as a journalist (or bartender) in no time.

I cleaned (a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kXrr6hzyCr9ckKVxfnko5g6jDZvkuKHFl7wJc4LxYI4/edit?usp=sharing")the data (/a) to free it from the one- and two-bedroom apartments that still came up in the Craigslist search, and also from some of the blatant outliers that looked to be either mislabled or scams. Here's a scatter plot of what I found.  You can see the general trend:

To put that in perspective, a quick Craigslist search of Des Moines, Iowa found that I could also rent a <a href="http://desmoines.craigslist.org/apa/5735193142.html"> four-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom, 2,189-square-foot house </a> for almost the exact same amount a month.  

I wonder if the <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/"> Des Moines Register </a> is hiring.
