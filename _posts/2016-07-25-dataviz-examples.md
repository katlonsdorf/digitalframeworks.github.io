## A Good and Bad Example of Data Visualization

I came across <a href=" http://www.lucify.com/the-flow-towards-europe/">this example of awesome data visualization</a> a few months ago, when I was doing a lot of background research on the refugee crisis in Europe.  It uses UNHCR data to continuously stay current, which I think is pretty great.  In terms of visualization, I like the simplicity of it.  It’s easy to use, and really easy to quickly understand—it takes just a moment to realize that the flow of migrants headed to Europe significantly increased in 2014, and that they majority of them are coming from Syria and headed to Germany by 2015.

It’s also apparent that there was a lot of thought put into it. Instead of making each dot represent one person (which might be overwhelming and cluttered), each dot represents 25 people, or a busload with every other seat taken (although I would argue that’s not super realistic).  It’s consistent and easy to follow, and I like that the user can control the speed and isolate a country to see specific data.

As you scroll down the data is visualized in two more ways to understand the story better.  I like the timeline flow chart that shows each country month-by-month because it puts the map into context.  And the soccer field info graphic at the very bottom is a simple visualization to show the much larger problem.   It’s probably my least favorite part of the whole project—the map is the most impressive feature—but it works.

I do wish that the timeline at the top was clearer and marked with years in a more apparent way.  I also wish it was easier to zoom out on the map itself, because it was hard to tell where some migrants are coming from.  

I couldn’t embed the map, but here’s a screenshot of it:

In terms of bad data visualization, I found quite a few, but this one below makes me want to die.  I found it on WTF visualizations, but couldn’t find an original source for it, so I’m not sure where it comes from.  I suppose that’s part of the problem with it, too—there’s no mention of a source for what data was used to make this visualization.

There are SO many issues with it, but the main one is that the percentages don’t even equal 100 percent, which makes me wonder where the numbers could have possibly come from.  My guess is that the data came from a survey where respondents could check more than one box, but then that should be thought about before the survey is conducted.

Beyond the math, I don’t understand why this data is represented on a human form.  Like, why is the crotch section tech-savv?  And the legs are people-savvy?  It makes no sense.  

Honestly, I don’t really think that this subject matter needs a visualization (just write 300 words if you have to and then stop writing stories that generalize generations because that story has been done a million times), but if you had to do something with this data, I would do a bar graph or something and be done with it.  And also figure out what survey it came from and why.
