## Coal Production in Afghanistan Skyrocketed After U.S. Invasion

Coal production in Afghanistan rose dramatically following the beginning of the U.S. war in 2001, according to an <a href="http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=ICS&f=cmID%3a11010-0">industrial commodity statistics database</a> put together by the United Nations.  Prior to the war, coal production in the country was nearly negligible.
 
From the 1995 until 2000, yearly coal production in Afghanistan was at 5,000 metric tons or less—far less than neighboring Pakistan, a country with relatively similar resources and geology.  However, Afghan coal production jumped by 2,500 percent in 2001, coinciding with the start of the U.S.-led invasion.  

Since then, production continued to increase, jumping by nearly 600 percent again in 2007.  By 2013, the last year of data available in the database, coal production in Afghanistan had increased by well over 100,000 percent since 2000. 

By comparison, Pakistan’s coal production dropped by over 30 percent during the same time period.  Coal production in major players like the United Kingdom and the United States also dropped by nearly 60 percent and 20 percent, respectively—although Afghanistan’s overall coal production was still a fraction of either of those countries.  

(It should be noted that the scale on each graph below is different.)

The increase in coal production in the country is directly related to the U.S. invasion. 

I dug into it a bit, and Afghanistan has been eyed by the international community for its mineral-rich geology for quite a while.  A <a href="http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnabl961.pdf"> study by the Agency of International Development in 1992 </a> highlights the multiple countries that have had interest in Afghanistan’s mineral deposits, including the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.

Afghanistan’s rough terrain and even rougher political history have made the development of its mining industry—especially coal—pretty tough.  The Soviet Union made a good headway into developing coal and other mineral production in Afghanistan for its own benefit, creating detailed maps of mineral deposits in the country.

When the Taliban came to power in 1979, Afghan Ministry of Mining officials reportedly hid the maps, fearing what the Taliban would do if they knew the country had so much wealth (this is probably why coal production dropped off to such low levels by the 90’s, but I couldn’t find data on Afghan coal production back during the Soviet Union).  It wasn’t until after the U.S. invaded in 2001 that the maps resurfaced, although I haven’t been able to find out specific details about how that happened.  

Soon after, the United States Geological Survey began conducting <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3073/2005-3073.pdf"> an assessment of coal resources</a> in Afghanistan along with the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industries and USAID.  It found that Afghanistan has “moderate to potentially abundant coal resources” and committed to “the institutional development of the various components of the MMI and its associated agencies, including the coal departments. The report continued by saying that the focus of the effort “will be hands-on training of Afghan geologists and engineers in the techniques of coal resource assessment in the field and office.” 

It was relatively soon after this commitment was made that Afghan coal production increased by nearly 600 percent.

From the USAID perspective, it seems this focus was meant to help stabilize and grow the Afghan economy, and was lauded as a way to tap into an estimated $1 trillion stock of natural resources for the country.  <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/resources-were-supposed-to-make-afghanistan-rich/">Critics have said</a> that the Afghan infrastructure and political structure was not stable enough to build the industry.

Fast-forward to this year (and keep in mind that the data I found for this does not include coal production for the years past 2013, so I don’t know where it’s at right now), the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) <a href="https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/audits/SIGAR-16-11-AR.pdf">published a review</a> of the nearly $488 million USAID has thrown into the mining and extractive industries in Afghanistan since 2009.  SIGAR found “limited progress overall,” attributing the shortfall in large part to the Afghan Ministry of Mine’s “lack of commitment to reforms, and other challenges in Afghanistan’s operating environment.”

(On a side note, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/09/201391515580675531.html">Afghan mines</a>—specifically <a href="http://www.deltageographic.com/coalmine.html#_self">coal mines</a>—look insanely dangerous and unstable.)

The biggest question I have after all this is who is making the money off of the increase in coal production?  If it’s not benefiting the Afghan population much at all, it has to be benefiting someone for such a huge chunk of resources to be poured into it.

Seems like there is <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2014/05/afghanistan-hidden-gems-20145211098919141.html">a LOT of money</a> to be made off of it all though...
