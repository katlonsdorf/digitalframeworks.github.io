## Coal Production in Afghanistan Skyrocketed After U.S. Invasion

Coal production in Afghanistan rose dramatically following the beginning of the U.S. war in 2001, according to an industrial commodity statistics database put together by the United Nations.  Prior to the war, coal production in the country was nearly negligible.

From the 1995 until 2000, yearly coal production in Afghanistan was at 5,000 metric tons or less—far less than neighboring Pakistan, a country with relatively similar resources and geology.  However, Afghan coal production jumped by 2,500 percent in 2001, coinciding with the start of the U.S.-led invasion.  

Since then, production continued to increase, jumping by nearly 600 percent again in 2007.  By 2013, the last year of data available in the database, coal production in Afghanistan had increased by well over 100,000 percent since 2000. 

By comparison, Pakistan’s coal production dropped by over 30 percent during the same time period.  Coal production in major players like the United Kingdom and the United States also dropped by nearly 60 percent and 20 percent, respectively—although Afghanistan’s overall coal production was still a fraction of either of those countries.  

(It should be noted that the scale on each graph below is different.)
